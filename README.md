## How can i install it?
If you're in this branch, then you can compile the source code by yourself, but it is still not recommended since there isn't a stable release, or it may not be finished, i recommend to wait for the master branch to be updated.

- GLFW:   `apt-get install libglfw3-dev`
- X11:    `apt-get install libx11-dev`
- OpenGL: `apt-get install mesa-utils glew-utils libglew-dev`
- For Gnome/Mate/Unity users: `apt-get install libglib-2.0-dev libgio-cli`
