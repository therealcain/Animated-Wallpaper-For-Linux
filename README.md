## What is it?
AWFL is an extremely fast software written in Modern C++ and uses GLFW and OpenGL to promise best results possible, it is a wallpaper tweaker software for linux that allows:
- Play videos/images as wallpapers.
- Play mouse animations on the wallpaper.
- Create animations, and wallpapers with Lua.
- Control the configuration.

## How can i install it?
If you're in this branch, then you can compile the source code by yourself, but it is still not recommended since there isn't a stable release, or it may not be finished, i recommend to wait for the master branch to be updated.
